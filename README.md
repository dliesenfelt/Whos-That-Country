# Whos-That-Country
If you grew up in the late 90's and early 2000's you migh have watched pokemon.
Each episode had a "whos that Pokemon" portion of the show, during which a silhouette of a poke mon was shown.
It was up to you to guess who it was.
So i decide to bring that format over from a fun kids show to boring adult geography!
Whos that country a game where you guess the what country is shown based off it border outline.

- You get 3 lives thats it GAME OVER, each wrong answer and you lose a life.
- You answer a question right and you add a point to the score.

That's it pretty simple.
